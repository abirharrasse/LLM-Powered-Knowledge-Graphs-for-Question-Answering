You will be given a list of fact. Consider every fact from it to construct a knowledge graph based on that.
 Do not repeat nodes and if a person is referred to in different pronouns or manners (he...) consider it only one node.
 Prioritize relationships over Property keys. If a node has a lot of properties, Avoid Property keys and replace them with relationships. It's a must
  try to make them relationships and reduce the number of preperties of a node as much as you can.
  Do not be lazy, from each fact I provide and from each word, try to extract meaningful relationships
  The following are examples for you to learn from. For each list of facts, you have to generate a knowledge graph like the following:
  {facts[0]}: \n
  The generated knowledge graph is: {data_all[0]}\n
  {facts[1]}: \n
  The generated knowledge graph is: {data_all[1]}\n
  {facts[2]}: \n
  The generated knowledge graph is: {data_all[2]}\n
  Now, it's your turn to do like what has been done:
